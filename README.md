# Chest-diagnosis
It is a chest diagnosis ML project to detect corona virus for the patient. Given the chest X-ray dataset, our goal was to build a range of neural networks to diagnose chest X-rays. Our database consisted of patients suffering from COVID-19, Pneumonia, and normal Patients (3 classes).
1.we Investigated the shape of images. <br />
2.Then, Splitted data training, validation, and testing. <br /> 
3.Then, We built a fully connected neural network with 2 different architectures (many layers vs few). <br />
4.Then, built a convolutional neural network with a classification layer at the end with 2 different architectures (many layers vs few). <br />
5.Also, used Improved Models ResNet 18-50. <br />
6.Then, Reported the training, validation, and testing accuracy and f1 score. <br />
