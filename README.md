# Chest-diagnosis
It is a chest diagnosis ML project to detect corona virus for the patient. Given the chest X-ray dataset, our goal was to build a range of neural networks to diagnose chest X-rays. Our database consisted of patients suffering from COVID-19, Pneumonia, and normal Patients (3 classes).
# 1.
We built a fully connected neural network with 2 different architectures (many layers vs few).
# 2.we built a convolutional neural network with a classification layer at the end with 2 different architectures (many layers vs few).
# 3.Also, used Improved Models ResNet 18-50.
# 4.Then, Reported the training, validation, and testing accuracy and f1 score.
# Group project
# My role: 
I worked on building the convolutional neural network.
